easyML - Machine Learning in C

📌 Project Overview
easyML is a simple machine learning implementation in C, focusing on the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify animals based on their features. The project processes a dataset of 100 animals, applies similarity measures, and predicts the class of new data points. This project was developed as part of a university programming assignment and demonstrates structs, file handling, algorithmic logic, and data classification techniques in C.

🔑 Key Features
✅ File Parsing & Data Management: Reads and stores data from external files using structs and arrays.
✅ Distance Metrics Implementation: Calculates Euclidean distance, Hamming distance, and Jaccard similarity to measure similarity between samples.
✅ k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier: Predicts the class of a new data sample by analyzing its nearest neighbors.
✅ Model Accuracy Measurement: Compares predicted and actual class labels to evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness.
✅ Interactive User Menu: Provides an interface for users to test different functionalities.
✅ Efficient Code Management: Utilizes Makefile for compilation and GitLab/GitHub for version control.
